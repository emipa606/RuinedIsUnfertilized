Fertilized eggs that gets ruined by temperature will now change to being unfertilized eggs instead.

This will of course only happen if there is an unfertilized egg type, as most wild egg-laying animals do not have that defined. Check out [Unfertilized Eggs](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2955797605) by Romyashi to let all eggs get an unfertilized type.
